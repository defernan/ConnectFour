<h1>Connect Four Instructions</h1>

<p>Welcome to Connect Four! This is a two player game where the objective is to get four of your pieces in a row. One player will have red pieces and the other player will have black pieces. Each player takes turns placing their pieces until either all of the spaces are full (which results in a tie) or someone wins by placing four of their own pieces in a row. There are three different ways to accomplish this:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Horizontally</li>

	<li>Diagonally</li>
	<img src="diagonalWin.jpg" id="diagonal"></img>
</ol>

<div id="final">
	<p>Simply click the screen in the location where you would like to place your piece.</p>
	<p id="luck">GOOD LUCK!</p>

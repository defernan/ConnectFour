Why we deserve 100 points!

We think we deserve 100 points because our design doesn't merely focus on just trying to get the game to work. We wanted to created a functional game that also focused on good coding practices. We tried to optimize time consumption in terms of staying away from double for loops and costly operations. We tried to minimize code reusage, commented our code, and ultimately applied what we have learned in school to create a quality application using the new features we learned in this class. Below are explanations of the specific  requirements met: 

css3 features:
	Animation used for the text output when a player wins or if there is a tie.
	Text-shadow used for the heading of the page.
	Transition used to enlarge all of the images in the instructions page when you hover over them.

Dificult features to implement:
	Logic for detecting the win was fairly difficult to come up with. 
	Mapping clicks to the coordinates of the grid squares.

Other Cool features:
	redrawing the squares with the correct color piece.
	The reset button to clear the game board to start a new game.
	The instructions link.
	The page is asthetically pleasing.

Also, we are awesome and very modest.
